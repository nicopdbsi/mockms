1. Decide on a “base unit” for recipes

For costing + Baker’s Math, your system should think in weight for almost everything:

Recipe base unit: grams (g)

Even if the masterlist says “eggs = pieces”, internally you want a way to say:

“1 egg ≈ X grams”

So in the Material (Eggs) record, you store both:

Purchase UOM: pcs (or tray, etc.)

Recipe UOM: g

Weight per piece: e.g., 55 g per egg (user-configurable)

2. How to store this in the Masterlist (conceptually)

For Eggs in your Materials Masterlist:

Name: Eggs – Large

Material Type: Ingredient

Purchase Unit: tray

Pieces per Purchase Unit: 30

Price per Purchase Unit: ₱210

Average Weight per Piece (g): 55

From this, BentoHub can compute:

Total grams per tray = 30 pcs × 55 g = 1,650 g

Cost per gram = ₱210 ÷ 1,650 g ≈ ₱0.1273 / g

Cost per egg (piece) = ₱210 ÷ 30 = ₱7 / pc

You now have both:

cost per g

cost per pc

3. Using eggs in recipes: weight vs. pieces
Case A: Recipe uses weight (e.g., 300 g eggs)

In the recipe line:

Ingredient: Eggs – Large

Amount: 300

UOM: g

System does:

Cost = 300 g × ₱0.1273 / g

Baker’s Math uses 300 g directly in total flour % math.

Case B: Recipe uses pieces (e.g., 5 pcs eggs)

You let the user encode it in the UI as:

Ingredient: Eggs – Large

Amount: 5

UOM: pcs

System converts behind the scenes:

Weight in grams = 5 pcs × 55 g = 275 g

Cost = 275 g × ₱0.1273 / g

For Baker’s Math and costing, you treat it as 275 g in the calculations, but still display “5 pcs (≈275 g)” in the UI so it’s human-friendly.

4. How this should look in BentoHub’s UI
In Materials / Masterlist → Eggs – Large

Fields you add:

Purchase details

Purchase Unit: tray

Pieces per Purchase Unit: 30

Price per Purchase Unit: ₱210

Conversion

Average Weight per Piece (g): 55

(Auto-calculated, read-only) Total grams per tray: 1,650 g

(Auto-calculated) Cost per gram

(Auto-calculated) Cost per piece

In Recipe Ingredients UI

When adding a line item:

Row for Eggs:

Ingredient: Eggs – Large

Amount: [ 5 ]

UOM: dropdown → pcs | g | ml (for other items)

Under the row (small text):

≈ 275 g • Cost: ₱X.XX

If the user selects UOM=g, small text flips:

≈ 5 pcs (based on 55 g per pc)

So:

Bakers can think in pcs

System thinks in g

BentoHub shows both

5. For Baker’s Math & Scaling

For a recipe with eggs:

You sum all ingredient weights (in g) – including egg weight after conversion.

Baker’s Math % is always computed based on total flour weight, but eggs are included in total dough weight.

When user scales using Baker’s Math:

New eggs weight (g) is computed.

Then you can also show approximate eggs in pieces:
NewPieces = NewEggWeight / WeightPerPiece

Example:

Original: 5 eggs (≈275 g)

After scaling: needs 413 g eggs

Show: ≈ 7.5 eggs → tell user: use 7 or 8 eggs (rounding hint)

6. UX rule of thumb inside BentoHub

Masterlist material defines:

How you buy it (tray, box, kg, pcs)

How you use it (recipe UOM + conversion if needed)

Recipe can accept either:

Purchase-friendly units (pcs eggs, trays, spoons)

or Exact units (g, ml)

System always:

Converts to g (or base unit)

Calculates cost and Baker’s Math using those

Displays friendly units + approximate conversions to the user
